    Passwd Plugin
    Copyright (C) 2009 Andreas Brodowski (brodowski at gmx.net)

    This is just a small passwd plugin that should show the possibilities to enhance Zarafa WA by plugins. 
    It is just a quick hack far away from being perfect or whatever. Feel free to use it in any situation 
    you like but feel yourself responsible for what you're doing since this comes without ANY warranty (ok -
    despite of that it will waste your disc space). In case you find bugs, please either fix them yourself
    and provide me the necessary changes to prevent the bug or at least notify me about so that I can fix 
    it.

    I publish this application herewith under the same License as the Community Version of Web Access to 
    easy you the way not even to fiddle around with different Licenses inside the Zarafa Groupware Solution.
    You may use it in Commercial Zarafa Groupware but for this plugin the License of the Community Version
    that corresponds to your Commercial Zarafa Groupware applies.
    
    To install it, just copy the content of the passwd-0.99.0.tgz archive into your plugins folder. Please 
    adapt the dialogs/pwdchange.php file according your backend needs (currently zarafa-passwd is in use 
    but taken from /usr/local/bin folder).

    A word about languages... They're in lang folder defined. I did it for the English and German language.
    Feel free to add your native language. It is not difficult. Just translate the phrases in file and 
    create same folder name for language as used in Zarafa, copy file there and use msgfmt to compile it -
    if you need help with this, feel free to contact me. 
    It would be fine if you could send me your translation so that I can include it in the distribution.
    
    TODOs until Version 1.00:
    - Implement real ajax communication to get rid of the post
    - Ensure that the module can only be used in https context
    - Implement backend plugin structure for passwd backends
